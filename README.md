## Wishing well (許願池)

A minimalist, Wabi-Sabi inspired web app that turns your vague wishes into fully functional single-file HTML tools — powered by **[Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/)**'s open generative AI APIs.

Just type what you want (e.g. "a relaxing pomodoro timer", "AI haiku writer", "minimal mood tracker"), click "實現", and watch the magic happen.
